### Story Title: The New "Lipstick Effect" -- Hit Korean drama boosts sales of lipstick products

### Abstract
A new kind of "Lipstick Effect" occurred in Asia during the past five years, as more and more Korean drama shows began to lead the trend in lipstick shades, and some even caused certain lipstick shortage. Customers are more willing to buy the lipsticks that appeared on some popular Korean drama shows. We collected all the search results (750 in total) of "Korean drama + Lipstick" at Baidu.com, which is the biggest search engine in China; then scraped the main articles of all these results (about 327,000 words), and calculated the occurrence of each lipstick shade from the collected text dataset. Then we used the data to analysis and visualize the popular lipstick shades, drama shows, cosmetic brands involved in this effect, and finally further proved the effect using Google Trend data.
